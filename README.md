# NiPypeTrial
Turning my masters research project on spatial smoothing for fMRI into a NiPype workflow to get use to BIDS and other techniques

# 🧠 Nipype-based fMRI Analysis Pipeline for Spatial Smoothing Analysis Effect

This repository will eventually contain the complete analysis pipeline for my Master's research project:  
**"Blurred Lines: How Spatial Smoothing
Influences the Statistical Analysis and
Interpretation of fMRI Data"**, developed using NiPype

## 📚 Project Summary

This project investigates how changing the spatial smoothing level of a single fMRI dataset can impact the statistcial analysis and interpretation of data.

I will be implementing a BIDS style pipeline using Nipype to integrate statistical analysis and preprocessing techniques. The aim is to get the workflow to be container ready and publivly reporducible.

## ✏️ My Notes from Notion ##

I will also include a few notes i have written in the process so i can have a cohesive journey displayed on how i got from knowing nothing about these software to (hopefully) having a fully working workflow

## 🧩 Features

- BIDS-compliant input/output
- Modular Nipype workflow (e.g., FSL + FreeSurfer + custom node)
- Reproducible environment via [Docker / Singularity / Conda]
- Clean, documented codebase for educational use
