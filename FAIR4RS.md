# FAIR4RS

this was spoken about a lot on the project proposal originally

---

## 🧭 Background

- The original **FAIR principles** were designed for **research data**.
- But software has **unique characteristics** — like dependencies, executability, versioning, and licensing — that require additional attention.
- In response, the **FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS)** working group (under FORCE11, RDA, and ReSA) adapted the principles.

---

## 🌟 The FAIR4RS Principles

### 🔍 **Findable**

- Software and its metadata should be **easy to find** for both humans and machines.
- **Key elements:**
    - **globally unique and persistent identifier** (e.g., DOI)
    - **Rich metadata** (e.g., purpose, author, version)
    - **Indexed** in searchable repositories (e.g., Zenodo, GitHub with citation metadata)

---

### 🔓 **Accessible**

- Software should be **retrievable** using standard protocols.
- Access conditions (e.g., open, restricted, embargoed) should be **clearly stated**.
- Even if the software is no longer available, the **metadata should remain accessible**.

---

### 🔗 **Interoperable**

- Software should be **usable across platforms**, and work well with other tools/data.
- Should use **standard vocabularies and formats** where possible.
- Dependencies and system requirements should be **clearly documented**.

---

### ♻️ **Reusable**

- Software should be well-documented and **licensed** for reuse.
- Include clear **citations, authorship, and provenance**.
- Metadata should include the **conditions for reuse**, and the software should be **maintainable** and versioned.

## ✅ Why FAIR4RS Matters

| Benefit | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 🌍 Reproducibility | Ensures other researchers can rerun your software the same way |
| 📦 Sustainability | Helps prevent software rot or loss over time |
| 🧪 Collaboration | Makes it easier for others to build on your work |
| 🧾 Credit | Encourages proper citation of software as a research output |
| 💰 Funding | Aligns with open science mandates from many funders |

## 🚀 How to Apply FAIR4RS

| Task | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Make software findable** | Register it in a repository (e.g., Zenodo, Software Heritage), assign a DOI |
| **Ensure accessibility** | Host on GitHub or GitLab; provide open licenses (like MIT, Apache 2.0) |
| **Improve interoperability** | Use standard input/output formats; document APIs; containerize if needed |
| **Boost reusability** | Add README, license, CITATION.cff, changelog, test suite |

---

## 🛠️ Supporting Tools

- **Software Heritage** – for archiving software over time
- **CodeMeta** – for standardized metadata
- **CITATION.cff** – for proper software citation
- **Zenodo + GitHub integration** – for DOIs and archival
- **FAIRsoft Assessment Framework** – evaluates how FAIR your software is
